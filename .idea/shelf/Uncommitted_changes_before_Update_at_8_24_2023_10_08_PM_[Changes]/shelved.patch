<+># Java Basics Module Final Exercise \r\n I want to make a system to track my university classes, teachers and students. Each Teacher has a name, and \r\n a salary calculated by the following rules:\r\n \r\n - For the full time teachers: base salary (attribute) multiplied by 110% of its experience years.\r\n - For part time teachers: base salary multiplied for its active hours per week. \r\n The university includes a list of teachers, a list of students and a list of classes. Each class has a name, an \r\n assigned classroom, a list of students and a teacher. Every student has his name, id, and age. \r\n # The program should: \r\n 1.   Initialize minimum 2 different teachers of each type (full time, part time). \r\n 2.   Initialize minimum 6 different students \r\n 3.   Initialize minimum 4 different classes including its teacher , students and other relevant data \r\n 4.   Print a menú including the following options: \r\n- 4.1   Print all the professors with its data \r\n- 4.2  Print all the classes and a submenu to select a class in order to print the class data including its \r\n teacher and students \r\n- 4.3   Create a new student and add it to an existing class \r\n- 4.4  Create a new class and add an existing teacher, existing students and its relevant data \r\n- 4.5   List all the classes in which a given student is included (hint: search by id) \r\n- 4.6  Exit \r\n # Rules  : \r\n -   The project must be uploaded to a new public github repository, which should be public. The repository \r\n should include appropriate use of .gitIgnore, more than one branch, and multiple commits. \r\n -   The project repository link must be sent to the Java mentors (David, Silvana, Lina) before the due date. \r\n The link must be specified on the following document:   The project is due on Final project repo\r\n Sunday August 27, 11:59PM. \r\n -   The project should include at least: \r\n -   Design Diagram (Any format you want, UML recommended, may be any standard format, even \r\n a cellphone photo) \r\n -   Access modifiers \r\n -   Encapsulation \r\n -   Inheritance \r\n -   Polymorphism \r\n -   Constructors \r\n -   Static attributes/methods \r\n -   Main class \r\n -   Packages and layers with proper naming \r\n -   Reading and printing (it’s not necessary to do it from console, should not be on the data model)\r\n
